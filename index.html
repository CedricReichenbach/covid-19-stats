        <p>* Note that the ratio of deaths per confirmed cases is not the same as mortality rate. There are a few
            factors
            skewing this metric:
            <ul>
                <li>Confirmed cases are just a lower bound of the number of actual cases, since <a

                        target="_blank">many may go
                        undetected</a>.</li>
                <li>Death cases correspond infections that happened earlier.</li>
